          Prince Prakash is a Grade 11, Science student of The New Indian
          School. His first MUN experience was in his 7th grade and he was
          hesitant in the initial parts of the conference. But as soon as he
          participated in his first Challenge against a senior upon Chair’s
          discretion, he got all worked up. He later bagged the ‘Best Speaker’
          award in the same conference. Ever since, he has found MUNs as the
          right platform to bring out the best among students in terms of
          thinking, debating and discussing. He also feels that every student
          should take part in MUNs, as it develops them to think on a global
          level and find solutions to real world problems. He also believes that
          a MUN experience will help delegates to unleash the potential they
          never knew they had. His other interests include cricket, basketball,
          chess, dancing, scientific theories and enjoying the art of films.
          Being the Secretary General for the first time, he looks forward to
          meet all of you and expects the delegates to attend the two-day
          conference with zeal and fervor.

          Alina Mahesh, currently studying in XIth grade of the science stream,
          will be chairing the International Press as well as heading the
          Finance Team. Having participated in 2 MUNs, she has earned the title
          of the ‘Most Diplomatic Speaker’ twice. Besides this, she has also
          participated in other intra as well as inter school competitions. She
          believes that MUNs provide children with the opportunity to widen
          their spectrum of knowledge on various matters. She believes that MUNs
          possess something magical that helps in transforming and illuminating
          a student’s life. Being the Head of Journalists, Alina believes that
          restricting journalism is equivalent to restricting democracy. A
          transparent and free press would be the perfect components of
          democracy. According to Alina, MUN is not just a platform where you
          come, speak and go, but, it helps in molding and shaping the young
          diplomats. As Malala Yousafzai once quoted, “I raise up my voice — not
          so that I can shout, but so that those without a voice can be heard.”
          Alina expects each and every delegate to rise and be the voice of the
          world. The world looks up to the upcoming generation for a new era of
          hope. So keep moving on the track of confidence and never let your
          fire of hope extinguish out.

          Shahid is a 11th grade Commerce student who chairs the Historical
          Crisis Committee at NewMUN IV. His first MUN council was Lok Sabha at
          NewMUN Chapter 3 in 2019. Since then, he has attended three
          conferences and won two best delegate awards. The first time he served
          on a crisis committee, it was maniacally delightful, and he hopes to
          emulate and improve on that experience as chair at this conference. As
          a novice speaker, he struggled to speak in front of an audience at his
          first MUN conference, but his first MUN conference improved his public
          speaking skills, and his confidence improved as a result. He describes
          himself as a loud introvert who looks forward to conferences and
          correspondence like this to meet interesting people with whom to
          discuss and converse. Having many strong liberal opinions on modern
          society, economy, and politics, he is a strong proponent of equal
          rights for every individual. He is also an ardent reader, a committed
          cinephile, and a wannabe linguist. With this conference, he wishes to
          improve and test his leadership abilities and make the two days a
          memorable and dynamic experience for all his delegates. Shahid wishes
          the best of luck to every participant!

          delegate in his councils, which usually stand out from the rest. MUN,
          he believes, has played an important role in his personal development.
          Sanish is easy to work with and get along with; he enjoys basketball
          and watching TV shows and movies. His first chairing experience will
          be at NewMUN Chapter 4, and he is looking forward to it. He intends to
          make the council as engaging as possible, to hold numerous challenges,
          and to give the council the feel of the Lok Sabha. Sanish welcomes you
          all to the Lok Sabha and wishes you all the best!

          Aaron Joseph, Chair of the US Senate, is a 12 th grade student
          pursuing commerce. Introduced to MUN in the 9 th grade, the first one
          being BritMUN, he joined the US Senate council, not knowing what it
          could be. Fortunately, he gained interest on the topics they had
          discussed, and there rose his passion for MUN; wanting to engulf his
          views among the other senators. Although in the beginning he fumbled
          quite often, he has now evolved and audience are astounded by his
          exuberant performance, transformed by years of MUNing. "Our discussion
          was primarily based on the issue of illicit immigration into the US
          state which really sparked my interest towards to the senate" he says
          As sessions moved on, he was found with great enthusiasm to shoot
          forth question and brave enough to raise his placards at any
          opportunity. ‘Although it had been a nerve-wracking experience, my
          first MUN conference made me more excited to debate and learn about
          the world around me.’ he said This helped him to be more of an
          extrovert, which in turn led him to communicate and reach out to many
          people, and guide others to explore something new. So far, he has
          attended 5 MUNs and NewMUN chapter 3 would be his first chair
          experience. "Chairing US senate is probably what I’ve been waiting for
          so long, and I’m really excited for this upcoming NewMUN, I hope it
          would be a productive and most importantly a memorable MUN’" Apart
          from MUN, he enjoys playing instruments like guitar and keyboard, and
          is also passionate about football and cooking. Aaron welcomes you all
          to the Senate, and wishes you the best of luck for the conference!

          Jessica Lawrence, a student of grade XI will be chairing the
          International Press at the NewMUN 2019. Having attended 4 MUNs, she
          considers it a platform where one can voice out their opinions on
          global issues, broaden their perspective on global scenarios and
          simultaneously enhance their skills in debating and negotiating alike.
          Furthermore, she also acknowledges the crucial role that journalists
          play in the decision-making process as they convey information to the
          citizens on the policies being made by the decision-making system,
          thereby sustaining its transparency and credibility. If conveyed in
          the right way by an unbiased journalist, it ensures that the decisions
          made are in accordance with the people’s will and helps avoid the
          misconceptions revolving them. Hence it is vital that a journalist
          accomplishes the above in order to maintain a healthy two-way
          conversation between the government and its citizens. Besides her
          passion for debating and reporting, she enjoys reading news articles,
          playing badminton and cooking. She would like to make the most of this
          opportunity by guiding the aspiring journalists into the world of
          journalism and make this experience worthwhile.

        Introducing, Shahid, a great MUNer known for his amazing accomplishments and inspiring leadership. He is a dynamic speaker and debater who has a unique combination of qualities that make him stand out.
He started out as a dedicated delegate and worked his way up to the prestigious position of Secretary-General. Quoting  John Maxwell - "The pessimist complains about the wind. The optimist expects it to change. The leader adjusts the sails.” This is what makes Shahid a good leader . He is also a virtuous person who is honest, compassionate, and has a strong moral compass.
What really sets him apart is his willingness to speak his mind, even on controversial topics.  His leadership goes beyond the conference room, inspiring others to strive for excellence in diplomacy and global affairs.
He is not just a successful delegate, but also a true inspiration to the next generation of MUNers.- Secretary General
